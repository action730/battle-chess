# Battle Chess

Battle Chess is just like regular chess, except the attacker doesn't always win the position, a battle decides the outcome. 

There can be many variations of Battle Chess and feel free to make your own! The canonical example will be [D&D](/DnD/basics.md) based and even that can have many, many different modes.
